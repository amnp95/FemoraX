# FemoraX design

## Purpose and scope

- FemoraX reads a model exported by Femora and runs the whole analysis on the GPU,
  or on the CPU through the same Kokkos code.
- OpenSees is the reference implementation. For the same model, FemoraX must reproduce
  OpenSees results.
- Scope is what Femora can emit, not all of OpenSees. The list is at the end of this file.
- Arbitrary Tcl (Femora's `model.actions.tcl`) is not supported. The reader rejects it.

## Architecture

Host side, once per analysis stage:

1. Read the model file.
2. Number DOFs, folding `fix`, `equalDOF` and the laminar boundary into the numbering
   (slave DOFs map to their master's equation; fixed DOFs map to -1). Any number of DOFs
   per node, and element-owned DOFs (see "DOF numbering").
3. Group elements into batches by (element type, material type).
4. Renumber nodes and elements for memory locality (RCM or a space-filling curve).
5. Build the sparsity pattern and the per-element assembly maps.
6. Allocate device memory for all state.

Device side, every Newton iteration:

1. State determination: one kernel per batch computes stress, tangent, internal force.
2. Assemble the effective stiffness and the residual.
3. Linear solve.
4. Update displacements; compute the convergence norm (one scalar returns to the host).
5. On convergence: commit state (swap buffers), copy recorder data asynchronously.

## Three code layers

1. **Physics** (`src/physics/`): element and material math as framework-free functions.
   This is most of the code and must outlive any framework choice.
2. **Launch** (`src/exec/`): Kokkos `parallel_for`, Views and Graphs that apply the physics
   functions over batches. Small and replaceable.
3. **Native** (`src/native/`): CUDA or HIP versions of a kernel, only when profiling shows
   the portable kernel losing real time.

## Data layout

- Structure of arrays for everything indexed by element, Gauss point or node.
- Material state is double-buffered: committed and trial.
  `commitState` = swap the two buffers, `revertToLastCommit` = copy committed into trial.
  This keeps OpenSees semantics, so retry-with-smaller-step algorithms work unchanged.
- State size is fixed per batch (for example, the maximum number of yield surfaces in a
  PressureDependMultiYield batch).

## Element and material contract

Adding an element is one header in `src/physics/elements/` plus one line in
`src/exec/element_registry.hpp`. Adding a material is the same with
`src/physics/materials/` and `src/exec/material_registry.hpp`. The concepts in
`src/physics/contracts.hpp` check every entry at compile time, so a missing or inconsistent
trait is a compile error, not a runtime surprise.

### Element traits

Every size is a compile-time constant, so the launch layer and the compiler see fixed-size
local arrays.

| Trait | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `NDM` | spatial dimension of the node coordinates the element reads |
| `NNODE` | number of nodes |
| `NODE_NDF` | `std::array<int, NNODE>`: DOFs per node, node by node (3 for a brick, 6 for a 3D beam, 4 at the corner nodes of a u-p element, 9 or more for PML) |
| `NEXTRA` | DOFs the element owns that belong to no node (0 for most elements) |
| `NDOF` | `sum(NODE_NDF) + NEXTRA`; checked by the concept |
| `NGP` | integration points |
| `NSTATE` | doubles of history state per element (material state at every point plus element state) |
| `MASS` | `Consistent`, `Lumped` or `Selectable` (chosen per element group, as stdBrick's `-lumped`) |
| `EXPLICIT` | whether the element may appear in an explicit stage (needs a lumped mass and `critical_dt`) |
| `MATERIAL_KIND` | which material contract it calls (`NDMaterial3D`, `NDMaterialPlaneStrain`, `Uniaxial`, `Section...`) |
| `Params` | plain struct: material `Params` plus element data (body force, mass type, ...) |

Element DOF order is the OpenSees order: node 0's DOFs, node 1's DOFs, ..., then the extra
DOFs.

```cpp
template <class Mat>
struct StdBrick {
  static constexpr int NDM = 3, NNODE = 8, NEXTRA = 0, NGP = 8;
  static constexpr std::array<int, NNODE> NODE_NDF = {3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3};
  static constexpr int NDOF = 24;
  static constexpr int NSTATE = NGP * Mat::NSTATE;
  static constexpr MassType MASS = MassType::Selectable;
  static constexpr bool EXPLICIT = true;
  static constexpr MaterialKind MATERIAL_KIND = MaterialKind::NDMaterial3D;
  struct Params { typename Mat::Params mat; double b[3]; MassType mass; };

  // Internal force plus all four Rayleigh damping forces of this element
  //   fe = f_int(ue) + alphaM*Me*ve + (betaK*Kt + betaKinit*K0 + betaKcomm*Kc)*ve,
  // the same as OpenSees getResistingForce + getRayleighDampingForces.
  // WantK = false is the explicit path: Ke is never formed (pass nullptr).
  template <bool WantK>
  FEMORAX_HD static void compute(const Params& p, const Rayleigh& damp,
                                 const double xe[NNODE][NDM], const double ue[NDOF],
                                 const double ve[NDOF],
                                 const double* committed, double* trial,
                                 double fe[NDOF], double (*Ke)[NDOF]);

  // Me as a diagonal (lumped) or a full matrix (consistent), per p.mass.
  FEMORAX_HD static void mass(const Params& p, const double xe[NNODE][NDM], double* Me);

  // Upper bound of the element's largest eigenvalue omega^2 of K*phi = omega^2*M*phi with the
  // lumped mass. The element eigenvalue theorem makes the largest element value an upper
  // bound for the assembled model.
  FEMORAX_HD static double max_omega_sq(const Params& p, const double xe[NNODE][NDM],
                                        const double* committed);

  // Stable step for this element under the given scheme and damping (see "Stable time step").
  FEMORAX_HD static double critical_dt(const Params& p, const Rayleigh& damp,
                                       ExplicitScheme scheme,
                                       const double xe[NNODE][NDM], const double* committed);
};
```

Most elements implement `critical_dt` as one call to the shared
`physics/explicit_stability.hpp` helper with their `max_omega_sq`.

### Material traits

```cpp
struct ElasticIsotropic {
  static constexpr MaterialKind KIND = MaterialKind::NDMaterial3D;
  static constexpr int NSTRAIN = 6;   // OpenSees order: 11 22 33 12 23 31, engineering shear
  static constexpr int NSTATE = 0;    // doubles of history per integration point
  struct Params { double E, nu, rho; };
  // Same math as setTrialStrain + getStress + getTangent.
  FEMORAX_HD static void update(const Params& p, const double* committed, double* trial,
                                const double eps[NSTRAIN],
                                double sig[NSTRAIN], double D[NSTRAIN][NSTRAIN]);
  // getInitialTangent, for betaKinit damping.
  FEMORAX_HD static void initial_tangent(const Params& p, double D[NSTRAIN][NSTRAIN]);
  FEMORAX_HD static double density(const Params& p);
};
```

The committed tangent that `betaKcomm` damping needs comes from `update` at the committed
state, or from a stored copy when the material is expensive; the material decides.

### Registration

```cpp
// src/exec/element_registry.hpp
using ElementRegistry = TypeList<
  ElementEntry<"stdBrick", StdBrick>,
  ElementEntry<"SSPbrick", SSPbrick>>;
```

Batches are instantiated for every registered (element, material) pair whose
`MATERIAL_KIND`s match, and the model reader maps Femora's type names through the same
tables. A pair that is not registered is an unsupported component, reported as such.

## DOF numbering

Nothing assumes a fixed number of DOFs per node.

1. **DOF space.** Each node has `ndf[node]` DOFs, read from `/nodes`. Each element's
   `NODE_NDF[i]` must equal the `ndf` of its node `i` (as in OpenSees), checked when the
   model is read. Node DOFs are numbered by a prefix sum, `dof_offset[node]`, so node `n`'s
   DOF `d` is `dof_offset[n] + d`. Elements with `NEXTRA > 0` get their DOFs after all node
   DOFs, through `extra_offset[element]`.
2. **Constraints.** `equalDOF` (and the laminar boundary, which Femora writes as equalDOF
   pairs) joins DOFs in a union-find over DOF ids. Each DOF named in a constraint must exist
   on both nodes. `fix` marks DOFs; if any DOF of a joined group is fixed, the whole group is
   fixed. Circular or conflicting constraints are errors that name the nodes.
3. **Equations.** Each surviving group gets one equation, numbered deterministically (in
   order of the group's lowest DOF id after renumbering). The result is `eq[dof]`, with -1
   for fixed DOFs.
4. **Element maps.** Every batch stores, per element, its `NDOF` equation numbers
   (`int32`, structure of arrays `[k * nelem + e]`), built from `NODE_NDF` and the
   offsets. The launch layer never computes DOF positions on the fly.
5. **Lumped mass and loads** sum through the same maps, so a slave's mass lands on its
   master's equation and fixed DOFs drop out.

Indices are 32-bit (nodes, elements, DOFs, equations, map entries). A count that can pass
2^31 (the nonzeros of a large stiffness matrix) uses 64-bit row offsets; the compile step
checks this.

## Stable time step

Each explicit scheme has its own stability limit for a mode with frequency `omega` and
Rayleigh damping. With `alpha = alphaM` and
`beta = betaK + betaKinit + betaKcomm` (conservative: all stiffness terms at the largest
`omega`):

- **ExplicitDifference** (OpenSees; damping uses the half-step velocity, so it is lagged).
  For one mode the update has trace `2 - W^2 - 2*xi*W` and determinant `1 - 2*xi*W`, with
  `W = omega*dt`. Stability requires `W^2 + 4*xi*W <= 4`. With
  `xi = alpha/(2*omega) + beta*omega/2` this is
  `omega^2*dt^2 + 2*(alpha + beta*omega^2)*dt - 4 <= 0`, so

  `dt_crit = (sqrt(c^2 + 4*omega^2) - c) / omega^2`, with `c = alpha + beta*omega^2`.

  Without damping this is `2/omega`. Stiffness-proportional damping lowers it, which
  matters for soil columns with `betaK` damping on fine meshes.
- **CentralDifference** (OpenSees; damping is centred and implicit). The limit is
  `omega*dt <= 2`, unaffected by damping. In milestone 1a only the diagonal case
  (lumped mass, `alphaM` only) is accepted; the general case needs the solver (1b).

`omega^2` is the largest `max_omega_sq` over all elements, a min-reduction of
`critical_dt` gives the stage's stable step, and both are checked at the start of each
explicit stage. A step above `dt_crit` stops the run with the two values and the element
that sets the limit; `allow_unstable_dt` turns the stop into a warning. Nonlinear runs
re-check every N steps. Tests run a single mode and a column just below and just above
`dt_crit` for both schemes, with and without each damping term.

## Element kernels

Applies from the stdBrick kernel on. The goal is that every element runs in the thread
layout that is fastest for it on each backend, with the physics written once.

### Pointwise physics functions

Each element exposes its work at one integration point as separate physics functions, in
the style of libCEED's pointwise QFunctions. The whole-element `compute` is built from
them, so the one-thread-per-element path and the team paths run the same arithmetic.

```cpp
template <class Mat>
struct StdBrick {
  // Geometry of point gp: shape function gradients dN/dx [NNODE][NDM] and weight*det(J).
  FEMORAX_HD static void point_geometry(const double xe[NNODE][NDM], int gp,
                                        double dNdx[NNODE][NDM], double& wdetJ);
  // Strain (and strain rate) from ue, ve; material update; the point's stress for the
  // force, including stiffness-proportional damping stress (betaK*Dt + betaKinit*D0 +
  // betaKcomm*Dc) * strain_rate. Writes sig and, when WantK, the material tangent D.
  template <bool WantK>
  FEMORAX_HD static void point_update(const Params& p, const Rayleigh& damp,
                                      const double dNdx[NNODE][NDM],
                                      const double ue[NDOF], const double ve[NDOF],
                                      const double* committed_gp, double* trial_gp,
                                      double sig[Mat::NSTRAIN],
                                      double D[Mat::NSTRAIN][Mat::NSTRAIN]);
  // Contribution of one point to node I's force: wdetJ * B_I^T * sig.
  FEMORAX_HD static void point_node_force(const double dNdx[NNODE][NDM], double wdetJ,
                                          const double sig[Mat::NSTRAIN], int I,
                                          double fI[3]);
  // Contribution of one point to the 3x3 block of node pair (I, J): wdetJ * B_I^T D B_J.
  FEMORAX_HD static void point_block_tangent(const double dNdx[NNODE][NDM], double wdetJ,
                                             const double D[Mat::NSTRAIN][Mat::NSTRAIN],
                                             int I, int J, double KIJ[3][3]);
};
```

Body force and mass-proportional damping (`alphaM * M * v`, diagonal with lumped mass) are
node terms, added once per node after the point sums. `contracts.hpp` gains these
functions when stdBrick lands.

### Thread layouts

The launch layer offers several layouts per element; each is one fused
gather-compute-scatter kernel.

- **Explicit stdBrick, team layout:** a team of 8 threads per element, one per Gauss point,
  and several elements per team (for example 4 elements = 32 threads). Each thread does
  `point_geometry` and `point_update`; the element's force is reduced over its 8 points in
  team scratch (shared) memory in a fixed order; then one scatter per node.
- **Explicit stdBrick, flat layout:** one thread per element runs the whole element.
- **SSPbrick** (one integration point): one thread per element.
- **Implicit assembly:** never hold the full 24x24 tangent in one thread. A team per element
  first runs `point_update` for every point (stress and `D` into scratch memory), then its
  threads compute the 64 node-pair 3x3 blocks in parallel (`point_block_tangent` summed
  over the points) and scatter each block directly through the assembly map. The force is
  reduced as in the explicit team layout.

Reductions within a team use a fixed order, so each layout is deterministic on its own.
Different layouts sum in different orders and may differ in the last bits; every layout
must pass the same verification tests against OpenSees.

### Choosing the layout

The benchmark harness runs every layout of every registered (element, material) pair and
reports the fastest per backend. The defaults live in a committed table per backend
(`src/exec/layout_defaults.hpp`), updated from benchmark results with the before/after
numbers in the commit message. A run option overrides the default for experiments.

### Later

- **Matrix-free operator** (with the implicit iterative solvers): store the material
  tangent at each Gauss point (symmetric, 21 values for 3D; once per material when it is
  constant, as for elastic materials) and apply `K*v = sum over points of B^T D B v`
  without a global matrix. For iterative solvers and low GPU memory. The assembled path
  stays for direct solvers and AMG.
- **libCEED comparison:** implement elastic stdBrick in libCEED as a speed benchmark for
  our kernels (benchmark code only, never a dependency of FemoraX).

## Machine-learned constitutive models (design note, no code yet)

- **Small networks** run inline at each Gauss point like any material. Their weights are
  material parameters, held once in a shared device array that every point reads.
- **Larger networks** use a **batched material path**: the element kernel writes the
  Gauss-point inputs to a buffer, one batched GEMM (or a short sequence of them) evaluates
  the network for all points, and a second element kernel finishes (force, tangent,
  scatter). The batched path is an official material option in the material contract, not
  an ML special case; the elastic-predictor / plastic-corrector split of the multi-yield
  materials uses the same mechanism (predict everywhere, then correct the compacted set).
- **Tangent:** the analytic derivative of the network, a network that outputs the tangent
  as well, or finite differences, chosen per material. Explicit analysis needs stress only.
- **Precision:** an exception to the FP64 rule. An ML material may compute internally in
  FP32 or lower; its inputs and outputs are converted to and from FP64 at the material
  boundary, so element, state and assembly code stay FP64.
- **History:** hidden states of recurrent networks are ordinary material state, in the
  committed/trial buffers, so commit and revert work unchanged.
- **Training** happens outside FemoraX. FemoraX loads exported weights from a file named in
  the model (a schema addition when the first ML material arrives).

## Assembly

- The sparsity pattern is fixed within an analysis stage, so maps from each element's local
  entries to positions in the global value array are built once.
- Maps are stored per node block (block CSR) to cut index memory.
- Two scatter paths: atomic add (fast, non-deterministic summation order) and graph coloring
  (deterministic). Validation tests always use coloring.
- Constraints use DOF elimination (transformation), not penalty, because penalty ruins
  iterative-solver convergence.
- Newmark and Rayleigh coefficients are folded into one scalar so the effective stiffness
  is assembled in a single pass.

## Time integration and algorithms

- First: explicit central difference (needs no linear solver; see the next section).
- Then: implicit Newmark with full Newton, matching the Femora examples.
- Later: ModifiedNewton, KrylovNewton, ExplicitDifference.
- The Newton loop stays on the device; only the norm comes back to the host.
  Kokkos::Graph can capture the iteration later to cut launch overhead.
- Staged analysis: the material stage (elastic/plastic) is a flag in `Params`; element
  activation uses masks. Rebuild the pattern only when it really changes.

## Explicit analysis

Explicit dynamics uses the same physics functions, data layout and batches. It is where the
GPU gains most, because almost all the work is element state determination.

- **No global matrix and no solver.** Each step: element kernels compute internal and damping
  forces → acceleration = (external − internal − damping force) / lumped mass → update
  velocity and displacement → commit. An explicit-only stage builds no sparsity pattern.
- **Force-only element path.** `compute<false>` never forms `Ke`, which removes most of the
  arithmetic and register pressure.
- **Lumped (diagonal) mass after DOF elimination.** A slave DOF's mass is added to its
  master's equation; fixed DOFs drop out.
- **Stable time step.** Every element provides `critical_dt` (characteristic length over the
  dilatational wave speed). A min-reduction over all elements gives the critical step, which
  is checked against the user's step at the start of each stage. Pressure-dependent soil
  moduli grow with confinement, so nonlinear runs re-check it periodically.
- **Damping without a matrix.** Mass-proportional damping is a diagonal term.
  Stiffness-proportional damping is computed inside the same element kernel from the
  velocity (strain rate times the material tangent), so no stiffness matrix is formed.
  It also lowers the stable step; `critical_dt` accounts for it.
- **Many small steps.** Run many steps per launch sequence (Kokkos::Graph) without returning
  to the host. Check stability and NaNs every N steps. Recorders sample every k-th step and
  copy asynchronously.
- **Match OpenSees.** Implement OpenSees `CentralDifference` and `ExplicitDifference` exactly
  (Femora exposes both), so results can be compared step by step.
- **Limits.** Stiff components shrink the stable step: penalty-type interfaces and contact
  (ASDEmbeddedNode, contact elements), nearly incompressible or saturated materials, and very
  small elements. PML3D carries its own integration parameters; check its OpenSees
  implementation before supporting it in explicit runs.

## Linear solvers

- Interface: `analyze(pattern)` once per stage, `setup(values)` per factorization,
  `solve(rhs, x)` per iteration.
- Backends to evaluate: a CPU direct solver for milestone 1; Trilinos (Kokkos-native) or
  PETSc for portable GPU iterative solvers with AMG; cuDSS on NVIDIA for direct solves.
- In dynamics the effective stiffness is well conditioned, and the previous step's solution
  is a good initial guess, so iterative solvers usually converge quickly. The gravity stage
  is harder and may need a direct solver.

## Precision and hardware

- FP64 throughout (one exception: the internals of machine-learned materials, see
  "Machine-learned constitutive models"). Laptop and consumer GPUs have weak FP64; they are for development and
  medium models. Large runs go to data-center GPUs (for example through Femora's TACC jobs).
- Apple GPUs have no FP64; on Macs FemoraX runs on the CPU backend.
- Kokkos enables one device backend per build, so FemoraX ships separate builds
  (CPU, CUDA, ROCm).

## Hard parts (later milestones)

- PressureDependMultiYield / PressureIndependMultiYield: branchy return mapping. Use an
  elastic predictor on all points, then compact the yielding points and run the plastic
  corrector only on those. OpenSees uses static workspaces and dynamic yield surfaces here;
  rewrite both as fixed-size local data.
- ForceBeamColumn with fiber or RC sections: iterates inside the element. Use one team
  (thread block) per element, threads over fibers.
- PML3D: extra DOFs and its own integration parameters; needs its own kernel.
- H5DRM: large HDF5 input every step; prefetch to the device asynchronously.
- Contact (ZeroLengthContactASDimplex, embedded node contact): branchy state updates.
- Modal damping: needs an eigenvalue solve; do it last.

## Model file (the contract with Femora)

- HDF5 with a top-level `schema_version`.
- Planned groups: `/nodes` (coordinates, ndf), `/elements/<batch>` (type, connectivity,
  material reference, parameters), `/materials`, `/sections`, `/constraints` (sp, mp),
  `/mass`, `/damping`, `/time_series`, `/patterns`, `/recorders`, `/process` (ordered steps).
- Femora owns the exporter. FemoraX owns the reader and the specification in `schema/`.
- An unsupported component makes the reader stop with a message that names it and suggests
  the OpenSees backend.

## Verification

1. **Materials:** a small driver built against the OpenSees source calls `setTrialStrain`,
   `getStress`, `getTangent` and `commitState` along strain paths (monotonic, cyclic, with
   reversals). Its output is stored in `tests/reference/`; FemoraX must match it.
2. **Elements:** patch tests, plus single-element comparisons with OpenSees.
3. **Systems:** Femora examples run through both OpenSees and FemoraX; compare time
   histories with documented tolerances.

## Supported-component target (from Femora's API)

- Elements: SSPbrick, stdBrick, PML3D, SSPquad, ElasticBeamColumn, DispBeamColumn,
  ForceBeamColumn, Truss, ASDEmbeddedNodeElement3D, embedded node contact,
  ZeroLengthContactASDimplex.
- nD materials: ElasticIsotropic, DruckerPrager, J2CyclicBoundingSurface,
  LinearElasticGGmax, PressureDependMultiYield, PressureIndependMultiYield.
- Uniaxial materials: Elastic, Steel01.
- Sections: Elastic, Uniaxial, WFSection2d, Fiber, RC, Aggregator, Parallel,
  ElasticMembranePlate, PlateFiber, Bidirectional, Isolator2Spring.
- Constraints: fix, equalDOF, laminar boundary, rigidDiaphragm, rigidLink.
- Damping: Rayleigh, frequency Rayleigh, modal, secant stiffness proportional, uniform.
- Patterns: Plain, UniformExcitation, MultipleSupport, H5DRM.
- Recorders: node, VTKHDF (so `femora.results` reads FemoraX output unchanged), MPCO later.

## Roadmap

1. **Layered elastic soil column** (CPU backend), in two steps:
   - **1a, explicit:** stdBrick and SSPbrick, ElasticIsotropic, fix, laminar boundary,
     Rayleigh damping, UniformExcitation, CentralDifference, node and VTKHDF recorders.
     Needs no solver, so the whole pipeline runs end to end early.
   - **1b, implicit:** the same model with Newmark + Newton and a CPU direct solver behind
     `LinearSolver`.
2. **Nonlinear layered soil column**: CUDA build, GPU solvers, PressureDependMultiYield,
   material stages.
3. **Laterally loaded pile**: beams, sections, embedded interfaces.
4. **DRM basin and dynamic pile-soil interaction**: H5DRM, PML, absorbing boundaries.
5. **Rotated two-pile bent**: fiber sections, ForceBeamColumn, multi-GPU using Femora's
   METIS partitions.

## Open decisions

- Test framework (GoogleTest or Catch2).
- Python bindings (nanobind or pybind11).
- Solver library for GPU (Trilinos or PETSc) and the milestone-1 CPU direct solver.
- Details of the HDF5 schema v0.
- FemoraX license. Code ported from OpenSees is a derivative work, and the OpenSees license
  covers educational, research and non-profit use; settle this before the first public release.
